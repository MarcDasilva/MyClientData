# My Client DataBase ðŸš€

## Description ðŸ“Œ
This is an iOS facial recognition app that can pull up custom user files with an image of a clients face, allowing quick and easy identification.

## Features âœ¨
- Utilizes MongoDB Compass
- Custom FastAPI
- iOS app built on Xcode through Swift

## Impact
- I received inspiration from this project from case studies on busy hospitals with difficulties identifying patients in a fast paced work environment. With the implementation of a facial recognition database, patients can be identified quickly and their information can be accessed quickly.
